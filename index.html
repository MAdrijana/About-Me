                    Hello and welcome, my name is Adrijana Milanovic, and I am a Junior Test Developer. Let me walk you through my journey of professional development at Ottometric. <br>

                    How did my Ottometric journey start? Well, it began with one simple email to Ottometric’s HR address, and a pleasant correspondence with the HR representative, Adriana. Soon after, I found myself in a meeting with the HR team, which consisted of two skilled professionals, Adriana and Milan. In my opinion, the meeting went great because both sides got to introduce and present themselves, in a professional and, more importantly, transparent manner. In the same day, I received my confirmation email, with positive feedback, to my delight. In the same exchange, we scheduled another, more technical interview with CEO of company. During this interview, I was given the opportunity to display my skills. But I did more than that — I managed to convey my passion and enthusiasm for the job and everything that goes with it.

            <h4 class="slideInLeft">Challenges Along the Way
            </h4>
                <p>
                    <br>During the internship, the first challenge I had to face, was the fear of the unknown. Once I got to know my team as well as the other colleagues, I realized that there was nothing to be scared of. After months of hard work and learning, I can confidently say that the majority of that fear was only in my head.<br>
                    The first real challenge was learning Manual testing and writting Test Cases. Although I have never worked manualy testing before, I wanted to learn it as quickly as possible so that I could be more valuable and proactive to my team.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the beginning, I was given some simple tasks, I started with Annotating videos, and I got to know the work that our company does. As the first week went by, I felt more and more comfortable. Soon, I started through the annotation and to test the application and write down the errors I find, so that after finishing the annotation, I would write a bug report and send it for revision.<br><br>
                    After that I was given easier tasks to write automated tests using the Selenium WebDriver tool, this is the part I liked the most so far. I love and am Challenged to write scripts and run automated tests.<br>

            <h4>
                <br>The True Value of a Mentor
            </h4>
                <p>
                    <br>From the very first day at Ottometric, I was given a mentor, Milan, who was in charge of guiding and monitoring my professional development. He was amazing and seemed to know and understand all my struggles.  Selflessly sharing her tips and tricks. In fact, whenever I needed help with a task, I knew I could rely on him for support. <br> 
                    <br>From my experience working in this company, everyone is dedicated and everyone tries to help as much as they can when asked for an explanation or help. They draw on the board, give examples, share some literature with the help of which it will be clearer to me, they really dedicate themselves completely, and I hereby thank them all. <br>
                    <br>After 4 months, I got a Team Leader, Milos. Since I am the only QA in the company, I was assigned to the Front End team.<br>
                    In the beginning, I received tutorials to familiarize myself with the basics of html and css, after that a course for frontend-basic level.
                    After that, as expected, I started getting easier assignments from my Team Leader. It was difficult but at the same time very interesting, I had great support from the whole team.
